# Data-Journalism
 ## Background  Welcome to the newsroom! I just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper.  I was tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.  The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. I will be sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  The data set included is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## My Task

I will create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 I will create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.My scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
